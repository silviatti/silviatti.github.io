Hello there! I'm Silvia Terragni and I'm a Ph.D. Student at the University of Milano-Bicocca. 
My research focuses on Topic Models and Natural Language Processing.

This site is still a work in progress. If you want to know more about my project and stuff, here you can currently find a small selection of my projects. 
Otherwise we can get in touch on Twitter or by email :)
