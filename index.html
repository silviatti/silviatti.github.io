<h2> About me </h2>
Hello there! I'm Silvia Terragni and I'm a second-year Ph.D. Student at the University of Milano-Bicocca. 
My research focuses on Topic Models and Natural Language Processing. 
<br/>
<br/>
I am currently an active maintainer and contributor of the python package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/contextualized-topic-models/">contextualized-topic-models</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
This site is still a work in progress. If you want to know more about my project and stuff, 
here you can currently find a small selection of <a href="https://silviatti.github.io/projects/projects">my projects</a>
