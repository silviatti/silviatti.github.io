<h2> About me </h2>
Hello there! I'm Silvia Terragni and I'm a third-year Ph.D. Student at the University of Milano-Bicocca. 
My research focuses on Topic Models and NLP. In particular, I am investigating the incorporation of relational information into topic models. 
<br/>
I've been also collaborating with <a href="http://github.com/milaNLProc/">MilaNLP Lab </a> on the combination of neural topic models and language models' representations. 
I am currently a active maintainer and contributor of the python package <a href="https://pypi.org/project/contextualized-topic-models/">contextualized-topic-models</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to know more about my project and stuff, 
here you can currently find a small selection of <a href="https://silviatti.github.io/projects/projects">my projects</a> 
and <a href="https://silviatti.github.io/publications/">my publications </a>. 
Otherwise we can get in touch on <a href="https://twitter.com/terragnisilvia">Twitter</a> or by 
<a href="mailto:s.terragni4@campus.unimib.it"> email</a> :)
