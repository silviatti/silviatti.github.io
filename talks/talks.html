<h2 id="eurecom"><b>Modeling Knowledge Incorporation into Topic Models and their Evaluation
</b> @ AllianceBernstein (17/06/2021)</h2>
Topic models are statistical methods that aim at extracting the themes, or "topics", from large collections of documents. 
We may have some knowledge, associated with the documents (e.g. document labels, pre-trained representations) that can be exploited to improve the 
quality of the resulting topics. In this talk, I will review different methods to incorporate knowledge into topic models. Moreover, 
due to their stochastic and unsupervised nature, topic models are difficult to evaluate. Therefore, I will discuss the issues of their 
evaluation and show how to guarantee a fairer comparison between the models. [<a href="https://silviatti.github.io/resources/EURECOM_17_06_21.pdf">Slides</a>]


<h2 id="alliance"><b>Natural Language Processing
and Topic Modeling Review</b> @ AllianceBernstein (30/10/2020)</h2>
A review of the tremendous progress in the field of Natural Language Processing, including Language Models and Topic Models. 
I also present Contextualized Topic Models, that get the best of both worlds. [<a href="https://silviatti.github.io/resources/alliancebernstein_30_10_20.pdf">Slides</a>]
