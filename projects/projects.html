My research focuses on the area of Topic Modeling and Natural Language Processing. 
My interests span multiple areas across NLP and machine learning, including Sentiment Analysis, Hate Speech, Word Representation, and Deep Learning.

Here a selected collections of some projects I've been working on.


<h2 id="CRTM"><b>Constrained Relational Topic Models</b></h2>
I designed and developed a semi-supervised topic model that jointly models the relationships of 
      a network of documents and some prior knowledge related to documents in the form of constraints. 
      My very first paper accepted to a journal! Check it out: </p>

<h2 id="bo4tm">Hyperparameter Optimization for Topic Models</h2> I am currently studying the impact of the hyperparameters of a subset of semi-supervised topics models.
    I'm investigating this problem by applying Bayesian optimization techniques to identify the best configuration 
    of hyperparameters for a topic model applied in a classification task. 


<h2 id="ecrtm">Topic Models in Relational Environments </h2> I am studying how different types of relational information affect the results of a topic model. 
    I am focusing of document relationships (e.g. citations) and relationships between the named-entities 
      identified in a document.
